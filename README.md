To design and implement a robust and scalable data pipeline for processing customer account data. The pipeline involves copying raw data from the bronze layer in ADLS Gen2, cleaning individual files by removing duplicates and nulls, and storing them in the silver layer in Parquet format. These cleaned datasets will be used to perform Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) Type 1 transformations and stored as Delta Tables in the Gold layer of ADLS Gen2. Additionally, a consolidated file will be created by joining relevant datasets in the silver layer, stored in Delta format, and used for downstream analysis and visualizations in Power BI. The solution aims to ensure efficient, accurate, and scalable data processing to support advanced analytics and reporting needs.
